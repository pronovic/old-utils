A "Secret Santa" exchange is one where a group of a people get together
and each exchange gifts with one other person from that group.  The
exchange assignments are supposed to be secret, so that no one knows
ahead of time who they will get their gift from.  Usually, there's a
small ($5, $10, $15) limit on the size of the gift.  Another name for
this type of exchange is a "grab bag" exchange.

Every Secret Santa exchange has several elements:

   * A group of people
   * A "theme" for the exchange
   * A maximum cost for each gift
   * A date/time that the exchange will take place

We sometimes place limits on the way the exchange is generated.  For
instance, a person should not be assigned themselves as a partner, and
we may sometimes not want to group two other particular people together
(say, husband and wife at a big party).

The secret-santa script will read a configuration file, and will then
generate an exchange based on that file and then notify the group
partipants of their assignment via email.

To run the script, build a configuration file using the sample file
as a starting point.  Then, run secret-santa in "test mode":

   secret-santa --noemail --results secret-santa.conf

If this seems to work fine (i.e. you get no errors and things seem
to match up as expected) try generating a batch of emails to yourself:

   secret-santa --orgonly --results secret-santa.conf

Every email from a "real" run will be generated, but you'll get them
all instead of mailing them to group participants.  This will allow
you to see what the emails look like, and it will give you a chance
to tweak your <greeting> configuration.

When you're satisfied, run:

   secret-santa secret-santa.conf

Or, if you want to keep a copy of the assignments just in case, run:

   secret-santa --results secret-santa.conf

The USAGE file and the UNIX manpages contain more detailed information
about available options.
