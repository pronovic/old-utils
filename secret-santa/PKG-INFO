Description: 
        
        A "Secret Santa" exchange is one where a group of a people get together
        and each exchange gifts with one other person from that group.  The
        exchange assignments are supposed to be secret, so that no one knows
        ahead of time who they will get their gift from.  Usually, there's a
        small ($5, $10, $15) limit on the size of the gift.  Another name for
        this type of exchange is a "grab bag" exchange.
        
        Every Secret Santa exchange has several elements:
        
        A group of people
        A "theme" for the exchange
        A maximum cost for each gift
        A date/time that the exchange will take place
        
        We sometimes place limits on the way the exchange is generated.  For
        instance, a person should not be assigned themselves as a partner, and
        we may sometimes not want to group two other particular people together
        (say, husband and wife at a big party).
        
        This script will generate an exchange and then notify the group
        partipants of their assignment via email.
