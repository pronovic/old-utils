# Installing package dependencies
## 

The Secret Santa script relies on a number of outside packages.  Before
installing Secret Santa, you must make sure that certain dependencies
are met.

First, Secret Santa is written in and depends on Python
(http://www.python.org), version 2.5 or greater.  Most Linux
distributions already have Python pre-packaged.  Cedar Backup also
depends on the Python 4Suite XML package, so it must be installed before
you install Secret Santa itself.  

Finally, in order to run the secret-santa script, you must have some
sort of MTA (mail transfer agent), such as Exim, Postfix or Sendmail,
installed.  I really have no idea what to do for this requirement
under Windoze.  If you get it working, please let me know how you did
it, so I can amend this documentation.


#
# Installing the package
##

Secret Santa is distributed in standard Python distutils form.  Use:

   python setup.py --help

For more information on how to install it.  You must have a Python
interpreter version 2.5 or better to use these modules.

In the simplest case, you will probably just use:

   python setup.py install

to install to your standard Python site-packages directory.  Note that on
UNIX systems, you will probably need to do this as root.
