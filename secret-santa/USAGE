USAGE

secret-santa [options] config-file


OPTIONS

-h, --help
Display usage/help listing.

-V, --version
Display version information.

-a, --attempts
Number of attempts to take.  For some configurations, it may be
difficult to find a valid exchange in a single attempt.  By default, up
to 10 attempts will be made.

-r, --results
Dump results to standard output.  This option is useful for testing
along with the --noemail option, or in order to keep a list of
assignments, in case a participant were to lose his or her email.

-o, --orgonly
Generate email to organizer only.  This option is useful for testing, in
order to see what emails to participants will look like.

-n, --noemail
Do not send any emails.


CONFIGURATION

The configuration file provided to secret-santa does not have to be
named secret-santa.conf, but must match the format described
below.  The secret-santa configuration file is written in XML, and an
example file can be found with the secret-santa source code.  This
manpage documents the file format and parameters for reference purposes.

The main configuration section, <secret-santa>, contains two other sections:

 <exchange>    General exchange configuration
 <group>       Information describing the exchange group

The <exchange> section contains exactly six elements:

 <name>        The name of the exchange
 <organizer>   Details about the organizer
 <date-time>   The date/time of the exchange
 <theme>       The theme of the exchange
 <cost>        The suggested cost of a gift
 <greeting>    Free-form comments for the email

All fields except <organizer> are free-form text.  The
<organizer> field contains three other fields:

 <name>        The name of the organizer
 <email>       Organizer's email address
 <phone>       Organizer's phone number

This is an example <exchange> section:

 <exchange>
  <name>Sample Exchange</name>
  <organizer>
   <name>Sample Organizer</name>
   <email>test@dummy.org</email>
   <phone>612.555.1212</phone>
  </organizer>
  <date-time>Christmas Day, 2002 (time TBD)</date-time>
  <theme>Free Software</theme>
  <cost>$0-$0</cost>
  <greeting>
Hello!  This exchange is a test exchange, that shouldn't
really be used for anything.  You would put the real greeting
that you'd like at the top of the email into this field.
  </greeting>
 </exchange>

The <group> section contains one or more <person> sections.
Each person section contains the following fields:

 <id>          A unique identifer for this person
 <name>        Full name 
 <nickname>    Nickname
 <email>       Email address
 <conflicts>   Any conflicts, identified by id

The <id> just has to be unique.  You can use numbers (simple)
or if there are no duplicates, first name or last name, etc.
There is no check to ensure that ids are actually unique, so
be careful!

The <conflicts> field contains a list of IDs that this person
should not have assigned as their buddy.  If there are no conflicts,
just list an empty tag, i.e. <conflicts/>.

Here is an example person with no conflicts:

 <person>
  <id>3</id>
  <name>Person Three</name>
  <nickname>Three</nickname>
  <email>three@dummy.org</email>
  <conflicts/>
 </person>

Here is an example person with two conflicts:

 <person>
  <id>4</id>
  <name>Person Four</name>
  <nickname>Four</nickname>
  <email>four@dummy.org</email>
  <conflicts>
   <id>1</id>
   <id>2</id>
  </conflicts>
 </person>

Be careful when assigning conflicts!  You need to leave some
possibilities open, and if you assign too many conflicts, there
may just not be any way to generate a valid exchange and still
satisfy those conflicts.


NOTES

It's possible that for a given pass, we might not be able to build a
valid exchange.  This might happen, for instance, if we get to the point
where the only people left to be assigned all conflict with the person 
we're trying to make an assignment for.

Since we're generating assigments pseudo-randomly, this isn't a
permanent failure.  We'll just try again (up to 10 times) to see if we
can make it work.  If it still doesn't work, there are you potential
fixes: either modify configuration (to change conflicts) or increase the
number of attempts (which might make a difference for larger groups).


BUGS

There probably are bugs in this code.  I whipped it together pretty
quickly.  However, it seems to work fine.  If you find a bug, please
report it.  If possible, give me all error messages that the script
printed, and provide the output that the script gives when run with 
the --orgonly and --report options enabled.

I would eventually like to add support for reply-to addresses and
few other things, but given how often I use the script, I don't think
I'll get around to it.  Patches accepted. 

Report bugs to <support@cedar-solutions.com>.
